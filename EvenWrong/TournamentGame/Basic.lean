A [tournament](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_(graph_theory)>) is a directed graph
where any two distinct vertices have exactly one directed edge joining them
(so named, presumably, because this is the graph we obtain from a round-robin tournament
in which each player plays each other once,
and we draw an edge from the winner to the loser of each game).

Given a tournament, we can consider the symmetric, two-player, zero-sum, normal form game
where the action sets are the sets of vertices of the tournament,
and where, if the players moves are distinct,
then a player receives +1 payoff iff the edge joining the moves originates on their chosen vertex.
We'll call such a game a _tournament game_.

structure TournamentGame (ActionMenu : Type)
    extends UniformActionNormalFormGame (Fin 2) ActionMenu where
  symmetric : ∀ (actions : (p : Fin 2) → ActionMenu), payoff 0 actions = -payoff 1 actions
  payoff_ne : ∀ (p) (actions : (p' : Fin 2) → ActionMenu),
    actions 0 ≠ actions 1 → payoff p actions = 1 ∨ payoff p actions = -1
